## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-18
### Changed
- **MAJOR REFACTORING**: Completely restructured NeuralNetworks.js architecture for better maintainability
- Separated monolithic 1664-line file into specialized service modules
- Improved code organization with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced API migration readiness for future AI provider changes

### Added
- **AICore.js**: Centralized AI API interactions and core logic
  - All X.AI API calls and AI processing functions
  - Easy provider switching capability
  - Secure API client configuration
- **ImageService.js**: Dedicated image generation service
  - Gradio integration and image processing
  - Progress tracking for image generation
  - Isolated image-specific functionality
- **ConversationService.js**: Conversation flow management
  - Memory management and context processing
  - User interaction handling
  - Conversation enrichment with relevant memories
- **SystemService.js**: System utilities and health monitoring
  - Environment validation and system checks
  - Logging initialization and management
